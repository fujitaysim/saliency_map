This repository contains MATLAB code to use the computational model proposed in:
Fujita Y et al. “Computational modeling of visual salience alteration and its application to eye-movement data.” Front. Neurosci. 2025.

* “main_simulation.m” is a simple script to calculate and visualize a saliency map from a given image.
* To run simulations, ensure that all required function and class files are placed in your MATLAB working directory, or added to the MATLAB path. Additionally, the code requires the Image Processing Toolbox.
* The results presented in the paper were produced using the code provided here, in combination with the CAT2000 dataset.
* Note that the CAT2000 dataset is not included in this repository. Please obtain it separately from the official source if needed.
